Connect Four:
Connect Four is a two-player connection board game in which the players 
first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from 
the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces 
fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. 
The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, 
or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. 
The first player can always win by playing the right moves.
